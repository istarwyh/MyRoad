Distributed computing is a method of computing that involves dividing a large task into smaller parts and distributing those parts across multiple computers. Each computer works on its assigned part of the task, and the results are combined to produce the final result.

For example, a distributed computing system might be used to analyze large amounts of data. The data could be divided into smaller subsets, and each subset could be analyzed by a different computer. Once all of the subsets have been analyzed, the results can be combined to produce a full analysis of the data.
